I've been feeling like my front end skills (CSS) are a little lacking so I think I'll try and start working through the [100 days of css](https://100dayscss.com/?dayIndex=1) challenges in my spare coding time.

I looked over the first one today and was able to understand some of the more complex css like animations and keyframes and such. I used a .scss file and got a little more familiar with the syntax of that as well, using variables to help my code along. It is pretty much an exact copy of the code to match. I definitely could not solve this without looking over the solution.
