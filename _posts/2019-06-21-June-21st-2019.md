Today I migrated my coding journey repository of .MD files to a github page using jekyll. It really wasnt too complicated after reading the docs and following the walkthrough to how it works.

I've been wanting to implement the blogging functionality to my coding log and am glad to be able to finally do it. I can now update my log from any of my computers using the git features in atom.

I had to install ruby on my desktop computer and I implemented the use of ROUGE which is a really nice syntax highlighter. I also styled the blog page pretty simply.
