Started the day working on the second 100 days of css challenge and completed it. It took about an hour, but I really feel like I am already getting used to the css animations syntax. Got to play around with the clip path CSS as well which was fun. Here is the solution:

<p class="codepen" data-height="265" data-theme-id="light" data-default-tab="result" data-user="jordanvidrine" data-slug-hash="QXgNzj" data-preview="true" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="100 Dats of CSS #2">
