Learned A LOT today. Worked with the very begginings of databases with MongoDB in the node course I am taking. I think learning mongo is going to be fun and allow me to create a lot cooler apps for my portfolio.

Also learned how to deploy an app to Heroku and have a working app with node on the back end ready to use and test and ship out. I also finished my stock app and pushed that to heroku today. It can be seen here: [Stock App] (https://jbv-stock-app.herokuapp.com/)

I didn't encounter any issues today that would call for me adding the code to todays update. Overall good day!
