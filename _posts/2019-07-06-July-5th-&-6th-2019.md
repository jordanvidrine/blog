Spent a couple of hours yesterday and today implementing pagination onto my site and blog. I met with a professional programmer and he had some great suggestions for what my portfolio should showcase, as well as some input for the blog.

#### Things I Implemented and Changed
**1.** The blog now shows a max of 10 posts on a single page. Each post also has a tag that tells Jekyll where to put the "Read More..." link.<br/><br/>
**2.** The home page is now my project showcase, and at the bottom of the page, my latest 2 entries show up for anyone who is interested to read it.<br/><br/>
**3.** I uploaded everything to my domain at [jordanvidrine.com](www.jordanvidrine.com) for a better online presence.<br/><br/>
**4.** I removed my github pages 'blog' and that all now resides on the github page for jordanvidrine.github.io<br/><br/>

After making edits, I use the ```bundle exec jekyll build``` command to build the site into normal html, css, and javascript files. I then upload that to both my github page, as well as my domain. I really like the consistency of my new site now and am pleased with the blogging functionality I put into it.
