Today I pushed my app in development to Heroku for testing and to show a couple of friends. It is now live at [jbv-drawing-prompt-app.herokuapp.com](http://jbv-drawing-prompt-app.herokuapp.com)

During the process I encountered a couple of CORS issues as well as some database connection issues. It made me glad that I added a console log to the mongodb connection JS file that either alerts 'Connected To Dabase' or 'Could not connect to database'

I got everything to work by doing the following:
<!--more-->

**1.** Changing my links the ```fetch()``` calls to be relative. Ie. From ```fetch('localhost:3000/prompt')``` to ```fetch('/prompt')```

**2.** Using the [cors npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors) and having my express app use it by requiring it and adding ```app.use(cors())``` to my express js file.

**3.** Since my app uses DELETE and other methods that the regular cors middleware does not cover, I also had to enable 'pre-flight' cors to the app by adding ```app.options('*',cors())```

**4.** Lastly, I logged into my MongoDB atlas account and whitelisted any IP address that is trying to make a connection to the database.

I spent the last hour or so of my day going through more NodeJS video course work.
