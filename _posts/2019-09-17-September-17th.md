Today I spent the first half of the day going through exercises in the Udemy React course I am going through. The course is still in the refresher stage for me as I know most of what the instructor is talking about.

For the second half of the day I job shadowed a developer friend of mine. He is a remote programmer and it was really great to see his process for working remotely. After seeing his workflow and speaking to him about how he feels about remote work, I believe the desire to work remotely has been even more solidified in me.

He gave me a great book called 'A Philosophy of Software Design' by John Ousterhout. I read through the first two chapters and am very intrigued. The main point of the book is to highlight the necessity of simplifying code and making your programs as modular as possible while it lends to being less hard to understand.
