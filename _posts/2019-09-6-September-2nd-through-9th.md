Last week and today I continued to work on the static site generator (InGen). Today I added the ability to add blog posts by saving markdown files inside of a ```/post``` directory inside of ```/content```. It's been nice to take a break from tutorials and focus on getting this project to work in the ways that I want it to.

I also updated my website at [www.jordanvidrine.com](www.jordanvidrine.com) to include a couple projects that I have finished or am working on since my last website update. Another thing I did was to work on my LinkedIn profile and update that a bit. I read a really great article on freecodecamp.com that helped me with the wording and how I should be presenting myself in regards to looking for work.

In between all of that I have also been reading through chapter 19 of Eloquent Javascript. The chapter is a walkthrough of creating a Pixel Art Editor inside of the browser using Javascript and html canvas. It's pretty complex, but I am working through each function and am able to understand what each part of the process is doing.
