I have already installed MongoDB during the Node Course but I will go through it again here. After installation, be sure to add the correct PATH to the bin to your Windows environment variable. To start up the DB run the following command in CMD. `mongod --dbPath "path to your db folder"`. After this you will be able to connect to the DB with the `mongo` command.

We will be working from the command line for now. This will be to reinforce how to work with the data regardless of what language we use. Later, we can use the Node.JS driver in order to interact with the data.

To see current DBs - `show dbs`

To open a DB, or create a new one - `use [db name]`

`db.products.insertOne({name: "Jordan", age: "32"})` would insert data to the `products` collection.
