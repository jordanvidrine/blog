Today I will be continuing with a couple of hours with the React course, followed by more learning of MongoDB, as well as some supplemental learning of Javascript algorithms.

The following code illustrates how you can bind a function with arguments passed to it inside of the render function. This would make it easier to pass arguments into something like a `handleClick` function without having to dive into the event to get data about the object that was clicked. This method isn't perfect, but it does work for simple applications. The reason is that, it creates a new function each time a component or piece of a component is rendered.
```javascript

class myComponent extends Component {
  static defaultProps = {
    color: ['blue','green','red','yellow','orange']
  }
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {color: 'blue'}
  }

  changeColor(newColor) {
    console.log(`newColor is: ${newColor}`)
    this.setState({ color: newColor})
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="ButtonList" style={{backgroundColor: this.state.color}}>
      {this.props.colors.map(color => {
        const colorObj = {backgroundColor: color};
        return (
          // this will pass the changeColor function to the onClick method, giving it the argument of the current color
          <button style={colorObj} onClick={this.changeColor.bind(this, color)}>
            Click me!
          </button>
        );
      })}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

This is new information to me and pretty cool! In the past, to get the "color" or whatever other dynamic data, I would try and read the `event.target.attributes` and use that to determine what data I needed.

### Passing Functions to child components
To maintain downward data flow, the code below is an example of how a child can execute a function defined in its parent, and be able to pass in an argument to that function, affecting the state of the parent.
```javascript

class ParentComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { nums: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] };
    this.remove = this.remove.bind(this);
  }

  remove(num) {
    console.log("REMOVING!");
    console.log(num);
    this.setState(st => ({
      nums: st.nums.filter(n => n !== num)
    }));
  }

  render() {
    // Key must be unique!
    let nums = this.state.nums.map(n => (
      <BetterNumberItem key={n} value={n} remove={this.remove} />
    ));
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Better Number List</h1>
        <ul>{nums}</ul>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default BetterNumberList;

class childComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleRemove = this.handleRemove.bind(this);
  }
  handleRemove(evt) {
    // calls the remove function passed in as a prop, with the value also passed in as a prop
    this.props.remove(this.props.value);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <li>
        {this.props.value}
        <button onClick={this.handleRemove}>X</button>
      </li>
    );
  }
}
```
What is happening here is that the parent component is building a list of child components with `LI` items and passing in `this.remove` as a function to each `LI` as well as a `key` and a `value` that the `LI` element will utilize.

In the child component, a new function, `handleRemove` is created, and inside of it, `this.props.remove` is called, which was passed in from the parent. It is given the argument of `this.props.value` that is also passed in by the parent.

This way of structuring parent and child components when data and functions must use one another is a great example of showing how data should flow down from the parent, and the child should be able to use that data in calling functions.

**Where to bind?** - The higher the better. If not necessary, do not bind in the child component. If you need a parameter, pass it down to the child as a prop, then bind in the parent, and in the child. Avoid inline arrow functions/binding if possible.

**Naming Conventions** - The following aren't standardized, but the instructor brought up a nice way of naming functions in the parent/child components.
- For consistency try to follow `action`/`handleAction` pattern:
  - in the parent, give the function a name corresponding to the behavior (`remove`,`add`,`toggle`)
  - in the child would be (`handleRemove`, `handleAdd`, `handleToggle`, etc)

### React Keys
Keys are used in react components to help identify which items are changed/added/removed. Keys should be given to repeated elements, like lists, or when rendering multiple of the same component. It helps to provide a stable identity for each item rendered.


**Picking a Key** - The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies items among siblings. Most often you can use IDs from your data as keys. As a last resort, if you are rendering data without IDs, you can use the index of the iteration as a key. _(Do not use indexes for keys if item order may change or items can be deleted. It causes bugs or other performance issues with component state)_ You can use a npm package that creates a unique ID when called when needed as well.

### Exercise
To test what we currently know, the exercise was to create a Light Out game based on the old school game made by Tiger Electronics. Instead of using any starter code, I created the game from scratch and didnt look at any solutions until I was finished. I surprised myself in that memories from other exercises from Eloquent Javascript came to mind and I was able to complete the solution without any help.

Here is my code:
```javascript

class LightsOut extends Component {
  static defaultProps = {size: 5}
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = { board: createBoard(this.props.size-1), nClicks: 0, completed: false}
    this.click = this.click.bind(this)
  }

  click(location) {
    let {x,y} = location
    let board = [...this.state.board]

    function flipLight(x,y) {
      if (board[y] !== undefined) {
        if (board[y][x] !== undefined) {
          board[y][x] === 0 ?
          board[y][x] = 1 :
          board[y][x] = 0
        }
      }
    }

    flipLight(x,y) // Initial location
    flipLight(x+1,y) // Right of location if exists
    flipLight(x-1,y) // Left of location if exists
    flipLight(x,y-1) // Top of location if exists
    flipLight(x,y+1) // Bottom of location if exists

    let completed = board.every(row => row.every(cell => cell === 0))

    this.setState(st => {
      return {board, nClicks: st.nClicks +1, completed}
    })
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="Lightsout">
      <h1>Lights Out Game!</h1>
      {!this.state.completed? <GameBoard board={this.state.board} onClick={this.click}/> : null}
      <p>{!this.state.completed? `Number of clicks: ${this.state.nClicks}` : `You Win!`}</p>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

class GameBoard extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="GameBoard">
      {this.props.board.map((rowY,yIdx) => {
        return rowY.map((rowX,xIdx) => {
          return <LightBox isLit={rowX? true : false} id={`${yIdx}${xIdx}0${rowX}`} onClick={this.props.onClick} location={{x:xIdx, y:yIdx}}/>
        })
      })}
      </div>
    )
  }
}

class LightBox extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this)
  }

  handleClick(){
    this.props.onClick(this.props.location)
  }

  render() {
    return <div className={this.props.isLit? "LightBox lit" : "LightBox"} key={this.props.id} onClick={this.handleClick}/>
  }
}
```
