title: "October 2nd - Javascript Algorithms + Data Structures"
---
As sort of an extra supplemental course, I am taking a [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Class](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/) by Colt Steele on Udemy. I am still in the early stages of the course but we have been learning about Big O Notation and what his means for the speed and complexity of functions.

We can categroize the complexity of a functions runtime by giving it a "Big O Notation." For example:
```javascript
function logAtLeast5(n) {
  for (let i = 1; i <= Math.max(5, n); i++) {
    console.log(i)
  }
}
```
<!--more-->
The function above has a notation of `O(n)` because the complexity is a linear one where as `n` increases, so do the amount of computations at a constant ratio. The amount of times the loop runs is always the amount of `n`. Now if we used `Math.min(5,n)` this would reduce the amount of times the function could run to ONLY 5 or less. Its notation would be `O(1)`.

This chart shows different types of increases in complexity of different O notations. Obviously, the less steep the curve, the better in performance. This doesnt necessarily mean that the larger ones cant work, because it may be totally suitable depending on your application. These are not hard set in stone rules, just good observations.

### Space Complexity
We have been using Big O Notation to define the runtime an algorithm takes to run, but we can also use it to determine how much additional memory we would need to allocate in order to run the code as well.

We will technically be talking about _auxiliary space complexity_ and not the inputs of the algorithm. We are focusing on what happens _inside_ of the algorithm.

#### Rules of thumb in JS
- Most primitives (booleans, numbers, `undefined`, `null`) are constant in their space.
- Strings require `O(n)` space where `n` is the string length.
  - If a string is 50 characters, it takes up 50x more space as a single character string.
- Reference types like arrays and objects also take up `O(n)` where `n` is the length or number of keys

Ex 1.
```javascript
function sum(arr) {
  let total = 0; // one variable here -> total
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) { // other variable -> i
 //    total += arr[i];
  }
  return total;
}
```
In the above example, we only create two variables, no matter what the input. So its notation would be `O(1)` - no matter what the size of the array passed in, the amount of variables remains the same... the space never decreases or increases.

Ex 2.
```javascript
function double(arr) {
  let newArr = []; // variable created -> newArr (the size of which is dependent on the array passed in)
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) { // variable created -> i
    newArr.push(2 * arr[i])
  }
  return newArr;
}
```
In this example, the space taken up is directly proportionate to the array passed in, or `O(n)` space.

### Logarithms
I dont know much about logarithms so this section should be helpful as well as interesting.
