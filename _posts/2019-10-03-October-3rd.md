Starting the day learning about using forms in React. This is something I haven't worked with so I am eager to learn how these are supposed to work in this framework.

### Forms
HTML form elements work differently than other DOM elements in React. Form elements naturally keep some form of internal state. For example, this form in plaint HTML accepts a single name:
```html
<form>
  <label for="fullname">Full Name:</label>
  <input name="fullname" />
  <button>Add!</button>
</form>
```
Normally, we wouldn't know what someone typed into the input field, until the submit event is triggered via the button. It will be convenient to have a JS function that handles the submission of the form, AND has access to the data the user has entered.

This technique is called a `controlled component`.

### Controlled Components
Ok, at this point, I realize I DO know what we are talking about. We are going to be using a function to always keep the state updated to what the user is typing into the form, regardless of if submit has been pressed.

This way we make React the 'one source of truth'. We keep track of all changing data in the STATE and then it is passed to the appropriate form fields.

This is why the component is referred to as `Controlled`. React is keeping the state, and passing it into the component to appropriately render. The only issue with this is that each form element that is tied to state causes our forms to get a little long. Each one will need the `handleChange` function, as well as a reference to `this.state.whatevervalue` to keep it all controlled.

#### Handling multiple inputs
In order to set the state appropriately for multiple inputs, our `handleChange` function will have to know which part of the state to edit, depending on which input was typed in.

In order to do this we will use an ES2015 feature called **Computed Property Names**.

ex.
```javascript
let microchip = 1432232113;
let data = {
  [microchip] : "Product One"
}
```
This is a pretty awesome feature as it allows an easy creation of keys as variables in objects.

So, instead of making a separate `handleChange` for each input, we can make a generic function for multiple inputs. To do this, we add the HTML **name** attribute to each JSX input element and let the handler function decide the right key in state to update based on `event.target.name`.
```javascript
handleChange(event) {
  this.setState({
    [event.target.name] : event.target.value
  })
}
```
### Passing Data Up to a Parent Component
In React, we normally have a downward data flow. "Smart" parent components with simpler child components. However, forms need a lot of state to work correctly, so we will make them into their own component. Here is some code to illustrate how we would do this.

```javascript
class ShopingList extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      items: [
        {name: "milk", qty: 2},
        {name: "bread", qty: 3}
      ]
    };
    this.addItem = this.addItem.bind(this)
  }
  addItem(item){
    this.setState(state => ({
      items: [...state.items, item]
    }));
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
      <ShoppingListForm addItem={this.addItem}/>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

class ShoppingListForm extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {name:"", qty:""}
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this)
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this)
  }
  handleChange(evt){
    this.setState({
      [evt.target.name] : evt.target.value
    })
  }
  handleSubmit(evt) {
    evt.preventDefault()
    this.props.addItem(this.state)
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <label htmlFor="name">Name: </label>
        <input
        id="name"
        name="name"
        value={this.state.name}
        onChange={this.state.handleChange}
        />
        <label htmlFor="qty">Qty: </label>
        <input
        id="qty"
        name="qty"
        value={this.state.qty}
        onChange={this.state.handleChange}
        />
        <buttom>Add Item</button>
      </form>
    )
  }
}
```
What we are essentially doing here, is passing the state of the child component, `ShoppingListForm` up to the parent form, by calling a function with the child's state as its argument from the parent into the child's props.

### Creating Keys with the UUID Library
Since React wants us to use keys for listed out items, it is nice to have a uniquely generated key for each of those items. We can do this by using the UUID Library. It is pretty straightforward in its use.

When creating items and adding them to state, we can do this:
```javascript
this.setState(state => {
  users: [...this.state.users, {name, email, id: uuid()}]
})
```
To use the id as a key, in a map call we would do something like this:
```javascript
<User name={user.name} email={user.email} key={user.id} />
```

### Exercise: Box Project

**Part 1 - Color Box Maker**
Create a new React application, which contains the following components:
- **App** - this component should render the BoxList component.
- **BoxList** - Place your state that contains all of the boxes here. This component should render all of the Box components along with the NewBoxForm component
- **Box** - this component should display a div with a background color, width and height based on the props passed to it.
- **NewBoxForm** - this component should render a form that when submitted, creates a new Box. You should be able to specify the Box’s width, height, and background color. When the form is submitted, clear the input values.

When each Box component is displayed, add a button with the text of of “X” next to each Box. When this button is clicked, remove that specific box. This will require you to pass a function down as props - the button should not be a separate component, it should be included in the Box component.

Here was my solution to this exercise.

```javascript

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <BoxList />
    </div>
  );
}

class BoxList extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      boxes: []
    }
    this.remove = this.remove.bind(this)
    this.create = this.create.bind(this)
  }

  remove(id) {
    let boxes = this.state.boxes.filter(box => box.id !== id)
    this.setState(state => {
      return {
        boxes
      }
    })
  }

  create(box) {
    box.id = uuid()
    this.setState(state => {
      return {
        boxes: [...this.state.boxes, box]
      }
    })
  }

  render() {

    let boxes = this.state.boxes.map(box => {
      return (
        <Box h={box.h+'px'} w={box.w+'px'} color={box.color} key={box.id} id={box.id} onClick={this.remove}/>
      )
    })
    return (
      <div className="BoxList">
        <h1>Box list</h1>
        <NewBoxForm onSubmit={this.create}/>
        {boxes}
      </div>
    )
  }
}

class Box extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this)
  }

  handleClick() {
    this.props.onClick(this.props.id)
  }

  render() {
    let style = {
      backgroundColor: this.props.color,
      width: this.props.w,
      height: this.props.h
    };

    return (
      <div className="Box" id={this.props.id}>
        <div className="Box-dipslay" style={style}>
        </div>
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Remove Box</button>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

class NewBoxForm extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      w: '',
      h: '',
      color: '',
    }
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this)
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this)
  }

  handleChange(evt) {
    this.setState({[evt.target.name] : evt.target.value })
  }

  handleSubmit(evt) {
    evt.preventDefault();
    this.props.onSubmit(this.state)
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="NewBoxForm">
        <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
          <label htmlFor="width">Width </label>
          <input id="width" name="w" onChange={this.handleChange}/>
          <label htmlFor="height">Height </label>
          <input id="height" name="h" onChange={this.handleChange}/>
          <label htmlFor="color">Color </label>
          <input id="color" name="color" onChange={this.handleChange}/>
          <button>Create Box</button>
        </form>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```
This was a fun exercise in implementing the ability for a child component to have its own state depending on what was typed into the form. I love using a computed property name in the `handleChange` function and knowing how useful this ability is.
