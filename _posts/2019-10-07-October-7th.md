title: "October 7th - React, Mongo, & Algorithms"
---
Had a great weekend at the Google Developers Group Web Dev conference in Nola this weekend. Spent all day Saturday on the campus of Loyola hearing some great speakers and had to chance to meet a couple of new people as well. The speakers were great, as was the food, and it was all only $10!

After talking with a couple professional developers, it seems that my goal of starting with a remote gig is a bit lofty. Not that it CANT happen, moving forward my wife and I will be thinking of cities we may want to live for a couple of years for my to get some experience in person.

Today I'll be continuing with the React course, getting into the Mongo course, and working through some Algorithms.

## MongoDB
I covered a LOT of ground with mongoDB in the node course I completed over the summer. I liked it a lot so I wanted to take a course that's sole focus was mongo. Im sure some of this will be repetitious, but I think it will solidify what I already know, as well as introduce me to some more advanced concepts.

To start, in  this section we'll be learning about **Collections & Documents**, **Basic Data Types**, and working with **CRUD** operations.

A database holds collections, which hold documents. These are created implicitly when you try and work with one. If it does not exist, it will be created in order for you to use it.

As noted in earlier exercises, to start up mongodb on my own computer (after install and config) I run this command: `mondod --dbpath="path to the mongo data"`

For most of this course, we will be working in the mongo shell as to not be specific to any driver/language. I am eager to work this way to get a better understanding of the underbelly of this database system.

The data in a mongoDB is stored as BSON data. BSON stands for BINARY JSON, for intents and purposes, it is JSON that is converted to BSON behind the scenes, and of course looks a lot like an object in javascript, with key value pairs.

The following would create a database named `flights` and insert a document into a collection name `flightData`.
```json
use flights
db.flightData.insertOne({
  "departureAirport": "MUC",
  "arrivalAirport": "SFO",
  "aircraft": "Airbus A380",
  "distance": 12000,
  "intercontinental": true
})
```
To look at what is in your database, you can use `db.flightData.find()`. Adding `pretty()` chained to the `.find()` method will format the data in an easy to read way.

## CRUD Operations
The following are some of the methods available to us to perform CRUD operations on our data.

**Create**: `insertOne(data, options)`, `insertMany(data,options)`

**Read**: `find(filter, options)`, `findOne(filter, options)`

**Update**: `updateOne(filter, data, options)`, `updateMany(filter, data, options)`, `replaceOne(filter, data, options)`

**Delete**: `deleteOne(filter, options)`, `deleteMany(filter, options)`

This would delete the first document in the `flightData` collection that has a departure airport of "MSY" - `db.flightData.deleteOne({departureAirport: "MSY"})` You could use any filter you wish to find and delete documents.

To Update some data, we can use the `$set` operator. It would look like this: `db.flightData.updateOne({distance: 12000}, {$set: {marker:"delete"}})`. What this would do is find the first document that matches the filter, then either update, or change the data identified as `"marker"`.

Something like this would be useful to find all data with the marker "delete", and delete only those from the database. It would look like this: `db.flightData.deleteMany({marker:"delete"})`

**Understanding `insertMany()`**
This, of course, allows you to insert many documents. To do so, you would pass an array of documents into the function, and the DB will create a document for each item passed in.
