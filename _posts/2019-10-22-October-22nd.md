I started off the day coding a solution to a 'Dad Jokes API' React site. Here is the following code that I came up with to build the site, rendering 10 'Dad Jokes' from an API, and storing them in local storage for retrieval after a user closes the page.

```javascript

// JokeApp Class
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import './JokeApp.css';
import Jokes from './Jokes';
import axios from 'axios';

    while (jokes.length < this.props.numJokesToGet) {

        headers: {Accept:'application/json'}
      })
      jokes.push({id: data.id, joke: data.joke , vote: 0})
    }
    this.save(jokes);
    this.setState({
      jokes: [...jokes.sort((a,b) => a.vote < b.vote)]
    })

  newJokes() {
    localStorage.clear()
    this.getJokes()
  }

  load() {
    return JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('jokes')) || []
  }

    localStorage.setItem('jokes', JSON.stringify([...data]))
  }

  vote(incOrDec, id) {
    let jokes = this.state.jokes.map(joke => {
      if (joke.id === id) {
        // Handle UP vote if vote + 1 will not go above 10
        incOrDec === 'up' ?
        joke.vote + 1 <= 10 ?
        joke.vote++ : joke.vote = 10
        // Handle DOWN vote if vote - 1 will not go below 0
        : joke.vote - 1 > 0 ?

```

After this, we are moving onto working with...

## React Router
Using React-Router we can use 'Client Side' routing. Traditionally, routing happens on the server side, but with React-Router we can do this on the client side.

**Client Side Routing**
This mimics server side routing without a user having to leave the web page. With this, although the server isn't serving up multiple pages, React gives us the ability to move around with different URLS, using back/forward browser buttons, as well as bookmark "pages" on our site.

### Adding our first route
React-Router isn't the only routing tool we can use, but it is one of the most popular (in React) and we will be using it to learn about creating and using routes.

Of course, first install by running `npm install react-router-dom`. We can then include the Router in our app like so. Here, we pull out `BrowserRouter` from its package, and wrap our App with it.
```javascript
import {BrowserRouter} from 'react-router-dom';

ReactDOM.render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App />
  </BrowserRouter>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```
To use the routes and have them dynamically render components we would add the following to our App.
```javascript
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import {Route} from 'react-router-dom';
import Dog from './Dog';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <Route path='/dog' component={Dog} />
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default App;
```
What is happening here is that we are setting up Route to look for "/dog" to be sent in the URL bar. When that happens, it will render the Dog component.

### Using Switch and Exact
You would think that by adding a route of "/" would render the main page component, but this is not the case. It works, BUT, the way Routes work is that they match everything in the route specification.

For instance, if I had two routes, one for "/" and another for "/dog", the second route would match both "/" AND "/dog", effectively rendering two components.

To solve this problem, we can use `Switch`. We use it by wrapping all of our routes with `Switch.`
```javascript
  <Switch>
    <Route path="/" component={About} />
    <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} />
    <Route path="/location" component={Location} />
  </Switch>
```
Switch will now allow only ONE of these routes to be rendered. Unfortunately, Switch works in an orderly fashion, so it will match the FIRST one that it thinks should be matched. IE. "/location" would match to "/" because it looks for the first matching Route, which would be "/".

We could order the Routes to work properly, but there is a better solution...`Exact`

```javascript
<Switch>
  <Route exact path="/" component={About} />
  <Route exact path="/contact" component={Contact} />
  <Route exact path="/location" component={Location} />
</Switch>
```
Adding `exact` to your Routes is a good standard is there isnt really a reason not to unless you need to. It will now only match if the path is EXACTLY the string in the specified path.

### Link Component
So far, we have used `<a>` tags for any links within our site. If we are linking to a route that renders a component(s) however, we need to use `<Link>` since clicking on an `<a>` tag sends a get request, re-rendering the page.

React will intercept a `<Link>` click and perform client side rendering appropriately. Instead of using `href` we use the prop `to` inside the `<Link>` component.

```javascript
import {Route, Switch, Link} from 'react-router-dom';

<div className="App-nav">
<Link to '/'>About</Link>
<Link to '/contact'>Contact</Link>
<Link to '/location'>Location</Link>
</div>
```
The above code will use the Links to navigate to the appropriate Route and render the corresponding Component.

If we want to use Links as navigation, instead of in text, we can use `<NavLink>` instead, which gives us the ability to add an active class to it.

```javascript
<NavLink activeClassName="active-link" exact to '/contact'>Contact</NavLink>
```

### Using Route with `component` or `render` as prop
There is a detailed difference we should be aware of when using `<Route component={About}`. If we do not need to pass any props in, this is fine. But if we do need to pass props in, it is better to use `<Route render={() => {<About {...props}}}`. Using `component` will instantiate a new component every time, while `render` will re-use the existing component.
