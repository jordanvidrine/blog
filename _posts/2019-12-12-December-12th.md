Over the past month I started working on another personal project putting together EVERYTHING I have learned this year. The app is a Client Contract management system to help my wife manage contracts for clients she works with. I also started participating in the Advent of Code 2019 challenge and that has been... challenging!

As far as size, it is a relatively small app, but it makes use of a custom API created with NodeJS and Express, mongoose and MongoDB for storage of Client and Contract information, the Authy API for authorization and Identification for client signatures, as well as a PDF converter for the client or user to download a PDF version of the electronically signed documents. I created the whole app using ReactJS as well using google's Material UI.

### Contract Creation
In this section of the site, a user would be presented with the contract creation section. This form was built with React and Google Material UI.

### Client Version
After the contract has been created and saved by the user, and ID is generated. When the client uses that ID in the address bar at `www.website.com/:ClientId` it will take them to their rendered client to be digitally signed.

### Completing the Signature
Upon visiting, the client can enter their phone number, which on the back end, signs the client up with Authy. They are then prompted to be sent a verification code, and after entering the code, can then sign the contract. Once that happens, the document is stored to the database as signed, with a time stamp of the contract, as well as the information sent to the back end from the Authy API to verify Identity. After that, the contract will render as signed.

### Further Details
After these aspects are done, the user can view all of their current contracts on a dashboard. Each contract would be rendered as a card that the user could click on to view the signed document and generate a PDF of it for documentation.
