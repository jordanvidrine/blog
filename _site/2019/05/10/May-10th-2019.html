    <h1>May 10th 2019</h1>

<p>Another ‘Office Day’ for me. I usually cant get much coding done on these days, BUT the Generator Manager for the company asked me to code him up something.</p>

<p>He needs a simple app that takes in customer information he or another employee will enter including:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Customer Information (Name, Phone, Location, Etc)</li>
  <li>Type of Job Quote (Generator Installation, Maintenance Call, Electrical Construction)</li>
  <li>If (Gen Install)</li>
  <li>Generator Information (Brand, Model, Etc)</li>
  <li>Warranty Info</li>
  <li>Notes</li>
  <li>Line Item of Project Costs</li>
</ol>

<p>Depending on the type of work, this form will generate a web page that will be formatted so that it prints out well on a page. The information will also be saved to a SQL database we have to keep track of customers.</p>

<p>I created a repository for this project and installed React using create-react-app so I can work from work or home or away for that matter.</p>
<h3 id="react-diagram">React Diagram</h3>
<p>Here is a diagram I made to help me figure out the components I will need to create to get the basic part of this app working.
