<p>Today was an office day for me, but I was able to put in a couple hours of coding in between tasks. Our company was approached by an oilfield company needing a webapp that can display information about their tanks in the field. They want a line graph representation of tank levels for the past 30 days.</p>

<p>I looked into D3 as I have some experience with it, but it is a little convoluted and not straightforward, which we need for others besides me not familiar with javascript to be able to continue this project once I am gone.</p>

<p>I found Recharts, which is a nice npm module for react that uses d3 on the backend. It includes a good amount of seemingly easy to use components to create charts and graphs out of data, rendering updates in real time.</p>

<p>The data structure will look like this:</p>

<p>Well in Field –&gt; HMI (attached to well) –&gt; server –&gt; convert to database –&gt; data delivered to web app</p>
