    <h1>June 4th 2019</h1>

<p>I worked more today on the nested todo app, which is now live <a href="https://jordanvidrine.github.io">here.</a> I styled it and added the ability to edit todos.<!--more--> I am really happy with the way it came out.</p>

<p>Heres a gif <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jordanvidrine/nested-todos/master/Nested%20Todo%20App%20Example.gif" alt="nested todos working" /></p>

<p>I also worked through and finished chapter two of the writing your own angular book. Itâ€™s SUPER DENSE, but I do feel like I am getting more and more comfortable going through the debugger and following along with whats happening behind the scenes in such a complex framework.</p>

<p>I began working on building a javascript calculator as another harder exercise for myself as well.</p>
