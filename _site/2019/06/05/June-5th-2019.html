    <h1>June 5th 2019</h1>

<p>Today I spent the majority of my time coding a calculator app using a basic react setup. It was the first time I used react without installing create-react-app with npm. It was super minimal and fun to work with. I used an npm jsx converter while working on it for the desktop version. The app.js file used online is actually the converted app.js I made using JSX.</p>

<p>The app is actually now live <a href="https://jordanvidrine.github.io/calculator/index.html">here!</a></p>

<p>And the code is <a href="https://github.com/jordanvidrine/jordanvidrine.github.io/tree/master/calculator">here!</a></p>

<p>I also created myself a github webpage as apart of this process. I will be posting my apps and projects online now to act as a portfolio of sorts. That is here <a href="https://jordanvidrine.github,io">jordanvidrine.github.io</a></p>
