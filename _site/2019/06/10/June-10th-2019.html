    <h1>June 10th 2019</h1>

<p>Man, is this year flying by! I’ve got to put some time into my artspark project so this week will be a slow one for me coding-wise. This morning I wrote a little script to help my wife pick a winner for a drawing she did with her business. We had 266 email submissions as well as another 50+ Facebook &amp; Instagram submissions.</p>

<p>I used a <a href="https://csvjson.com/csv2json">CSV to JSON converter</a> to parse through the email list and convert that into an array of names. We then added to that array by using a simple html input I made. We entered the user name, and the amount of submission, and the submit button would push that (x) amount of times into the array of submits.</p>

<p>I then picked a random user from the array with the simple<code class="highlighter-rouge">Math.floor(Math.random()*array.length)</code></p>

<p>I also updated the styling of my calculator app, and reformatted my LinkedIn profile and resume to reflect my current career path.</p>

<h4 id="calculator-update">Calculator update</h4>
<p>Got to work on this for awhile tonight and encountered multiple bugs. Pressing “=” when current input or formula evaluated to 0 resulted in NaN. I fixed that. I am also implementing the ability to more intelligently use the decimal place. In the past I treated it as an operator and would not allow it after a regular operator symbol.</p>

<p>Now pressing “.” after an operator will cause the formula to be built like such “4 + 0.” or “4 x 0.” and it will wait for the next number input to decide what the fractioned number should be.</p>

<p>Other Issues I need to work on:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Need to STOP the entering of multiple decimals in a number</li>
  <li>Need to add “0.” to formula and current input when “.” is pressed for the first time after “=” or operator</li>
  <li>Need to stop number from getting too large for its Screen</li>
  <li>An operator should not be able to be entered right after a “.” press</li>
</ol>
