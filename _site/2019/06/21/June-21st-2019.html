    <h1>June 21st 2019</h1>

<p>Today I migrated my coding journey repository of .MD files to a github page using jekyll. It really wasnt too complicated after reading the docs and following the walkthrough to how it works. Iâ€™ve been wanting to implement the blogging functionality to my coding log and am glad to be able to finally do it. I can now update my log from any of my computers using the git features in atom.</p>

<p>Take a look at it <a href="https://jordanvidrine.github.io/blog">here</a></p>
