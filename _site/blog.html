<p>I started off the day working on the Drum Machine App I began work on last week. I implemented a click and drag volume knob, as well as the ability to hover over the knob and increase/decrease the volume with the mouse wheel.</p>

<p>Super productive day for me today. I went back to my Pomodoro App and finalized the look of it, as well as updated some of the code. Since I now know how to create React Apps without the bulk of installing a ton of node packages, I was able to re-format my code to upload onto my new github portfolio.</p>

<p>Today I spent the majority of my time coding a calculator app using a basic react setup. It was the first time I used react without installing create-react-app with npm. It was super minimal and fun to work with. I used an npm jsx converter while working on it for the desktop version. The app.js file used online is actually the converted app.js I made using JSX.</p>

<p>Spent a couple hours working back on the nested todos exercise for the Watch and Code premium users. I was excited to FIX the issue where my nested todos were rendering BEFORE their parent element.
A couple issues still exist however:</p>

<p>Today was an office day for me, but I was able to put in a couple hours of coding in between tasks. Our company was approached by an oilfield company needing a webapp that can display information about their tanks in the field. They want a line graph representation of tank levels for the past 30 days.</p>

<p>Another ‘Office Day’ for me. I usually cant get much coding done on these days, BUT the Generator Manager for the company asked me to code him up something.
He needs a simple app that takes in customer information he or another employee will enter including:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Customer Information (Name, Phone, Location, Etc)</li>
  <li>Type of Job Quote (Generator Installation, Maintenance Call, Electrical Construction)</li>
  <li>If (Gen Install)</li>
  <li>Generator Information (Brand, Model, Etc)</li>
  <li>Warranty Info</li>
  <li>Notes</li>
  <li>Line Item of Project Costs</li>
</ol>

<p>Today was an office day at my day job. On my breaks I looked more into github and how to create a repository using Git Bash on windows. I created the <a href="https://github.com/jordanvidrine/coding-journey">coding-journey</a> repository on my work pc and documented the work I completed on 5-8-19.</p>

<p>Today I read through <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html">Chapter 5</a> of eloquent Javascript. It solidified a lot of the things about callbacks and higher-order functions in the udemy course I finished last month. I was able to solve the exercises at the end of the book without much struggle.</p>
