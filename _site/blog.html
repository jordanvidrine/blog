      <p><p>Spent the first part of the day working through Eloquent Javascript chapters 8-9 on error handling and the dreaded regex. Not a huge fan of working with regex as it is pretty confusing but I do understand it and its purposes.</p>

      <p><p>I finished the Drum Machine React App and uploaded it <a href="https://jordanvidrine.github.io/drumMachine/index.html">here</a>. I am pretty proud of the way it came out as well. It was cool to finish this without really encountering any issues. I learned more about mouse and click events creating the app, but other than that, it was really easy.</p>

      <p><p>I started off the day working on the Drum Machine App I began work on last week. I implemented a click and drag volume knob, as well as the ability to hover over the knob and increase/decrease the volume with the mouse wheel.</p>

      <p><p>Super productive day for me today. I went back to my Pomodoro App and finalized the look of it, as well as updated some of the code. Since I now know how to create React Apps without the bulk of installing a ton of node packages, I was able to re-format my code to upload onto my new github portfolio.</p>

      <p><p>Today I finished the calculator app to the best of my ability. I fixed all of the issues I had with it and it is now complete. Worked through chapter 3 of Build your Own Angular.</p>

      <p><p>Man, is this year flying by! I’ve got to put some time into my artspark project so this week will be a slow one for me coding-wise. This morning I wrote a little script to help my wife pick a winner for a drawing she did with her business. We had 266 email submissions as well as another 50+ Facebook &amp; Instagram submissions.</p>

      <p><p>Today I spent the majority of my time coding a calculator app using a basic react setup. It was the first time I used react without installing create-react-app with npm. It was super minimal and fun to work with. I used an npm jsx converter while working on it for the desktop version. The app.js file used online is actually the converted app.js I made using JSX.</p>

      <p><p>I worked more today on the nested todo app, which is now live <a href="https://jordanvidrine.github.io">here.</a> I styled it and added the ability to edit todos.<!--more--> I am really happy with the way it came out.</p>

      <p><p>Spent the first half of the day going through 3/4 of chapter two of ‘Build your own AngularJS.’ Getting used to looking at fairly complex code and running a lot of functions in the jasmine debugger to see what exactly is going on behind the scenes.</p>

      <p><p>Spent a couple hours working back on the nested todos exercise for the Watch and Code premium users. I was excited to FIX the issue where my nested todos were rendering BEFORE their parent element.</p>

      <p><p>Today was an office day for me, but I was able to put in a couple hours of coding in between tasks. Our company was approached by an oilfield company needing a webapp that can display information about their tanks in the field. They want a line graph representation of tank levels for the past 30 days.</p>

      <p><p>Today I worked mostly on the last two ‘beast’ exercises from <a href="https://watchandcode.com/">watch and code premium.</a> I spent a lot of time in the debugger with this one, but I finally got it. I essentially split the number given to the function into a ‘left’ and ‘right’ side of the decmial.</p>

      <h2><a href="/2019/05/20/May-20th-2019.html">May 20th 2019</a></h2>
      <p><p>Today I worked through most of the exercises in the ‘Beasts’ section of <a href="https://watchandcode.com/">Watch and Code</a>. I keep going back to this course when something im learning stumps me. I hope to finish up all of the exercises and videos by the end of next month. Once that’s done I’ll get back to the Udemy courses on Node/Mongo/React etc.</p>

      <p><p>Today was an office day at my day job. On my breaks I looked more into github and how to create a repository using Git Bash on windows. I created the <a href="https://github.com/jordanvidrine/coding-journey">coding-journey</a> repository on my work pc and documented the work I completed on 5-8-19.</p>

      <p><p>Today I read through <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html">Chapter 5</a>of eloquent Javascript. It solidified a lot of the things about callbacks and higher-order functions in the udemy course I finished last month. I was able to solve the exercises at the end of the book without much struggle.</p>
